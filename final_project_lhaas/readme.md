# ðŸš¦ Traffic Flow Prediction Project

This repository contains all code used during the traffic prediction project. The goal was to develop and evaluate models capable of accurately predicting short-term traffic flow.
## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The codebase is organized to ensure a clear separation between training and evaluation.

| File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **`preprocessing_traffic_flow_training.ipynb`** | Preprocessing for training data. |
| **`preprocessing_traffic_flow_evaluation.ipynb`** | Preprocessing for evaluation data. |
| **`traffic_flow_training.ipynb`** | Model training and validation. |
| **`traffic_flow_evaluation.ipynb`** | Evaluation of trained models on evaluation data. Generates metrics and visualizations for comparison. |
